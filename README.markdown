What's Latte?
=============

Latte is a quick and dirty implementation of the Product Design Document (PDD) concept. It helps designers produce PDD automagically.

PDD, as a methodology developed and introduced to public by Felix Ding in 2009, is a new way for organizing design documents. It combines Use Cases, Flowcharts and Wireframes altogether beautifully, making the reading experience much more pleasant comparing with traditional PRD/MRD.

Latte is a open source software, fork it on Github!
