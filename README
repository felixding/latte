== What's Latte?

Latte is a quick and dirty implementation of the Product Design Document (PDD) concept. It helps designers produce PDD automagically.

PDD is a new way of organizing design documents. It combines User Cases, Flowcharts and Wireframes altogether beautifully. The concept is developed and introduced to public by Felix Ding. Check out http://dingyu.me/blog/product-design-document for more information.
